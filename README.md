## the data from House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
Predict sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting.

### This is a self-study project I created to improve my skills in data science and machine learning.
I explored how to work with tabular data, build predictive models, and understand feature importance using TensorFlow Decision Forests.
The project helped me gain hands-on experience in 
+  Data visualization 
+  Understanding numerical and categorical features
+  Building baseline models with Random Forests
+  Analyzing model performance and feature importance
